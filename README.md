# Android mouse

Testing client for sending mouse data via bluetooth from an Android Application to a Bluetooth server. It's far from done. 
The application takes data from the phone's accelerator sensor and process it to get new coordinates.

## Getting Started

In the app choose your PC in the paired devices and after a calibration routine the phone will send the new coordinates.
